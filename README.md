# CheatAtWordle
 C++ Program that uses a dictionary text file to cheat at the game Wordle. Also includes other tasks/functions.|


This was my second assignment for my 'Object Orientated Programming with C++' unit at University. 

It uses a dictionary text file to run tasks such as:
- Searching for a word and printing its definition
- Finding all words with a specific number of characters
- Finds all words with a 'q' without a following 'u'
- List all words that are palindromes
- Find Anagrams
- Guessing game
- Cheat At Wordle
